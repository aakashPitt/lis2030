    "This document is  a *Jupyter Notebook* and you will be reading and writing a lot of these notebooks in the course. Jupyter Notebooks are a special kind of document that blends together human readable text (what you are reading right now) with executable code (below). You can kind of think of Jupyter Notebooks as the Microsoft Word Doc of programming.\n",

All of the new terminology, technology, and fiddly computer bits can be a bit overwhelming at first. If you ever have questions, please feel free to reach out to the teaching team. \n",

    "Learning to program involves a lot of exploring and lots and lots of hit and a miss effort. We must open ourselves to the (often frustrating) experience of trying and seeing things fail. But computers are highly resilient. If we make a mistake on a computer program (in low stakes context like a class), we can correct it with little cost. That's the idea for this part. Let's play around with Python code below and see what we can do. Perhaps start by something as simple as printing out \"Hello, LIS 2030!\" and printing the output of sum of two numbers. \n",
